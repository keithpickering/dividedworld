-- A character's two pages, each in one read (docs/plans/2026-11-05-forum-load-plan.md, Task 6; the design,
-- docs/plans/2026-11-05-forum-load-design.md, section 2). profile_page(character) holds what ProfileScreen's load reads
-- today (engine/ui/profile/Profile.tsx) and record_page(character, kind, page) what RecordScreen's reads
-- (engine/ui/profile/Record.tsx, with the targets and Turns' Acts engine/ui/profile/record.ts reads), each piece the
-- row the matching view read gives the adapter (web/src/data/supabase.ts), so the adapter maps it with the converters it
-- has. Each is null where characters_public does not show the character, as today: a character waiting to debut and one
-- that does not exist are the same answer.
--
-- Bounded: a profile holds the newest 5 Acts (PROFILE_ROWS) and at most 50 season reveals; a record page holds at most
-- 20 Acts (RECORD_PAGE) plus, for kind `all`, the Acts the character's reveals, Turns and season reveals ahead of the
-- window push the read down by (as `mergeWindow` asks), so never more than 20 plus those short lists. A Turn's and a
-- card play's target Acts are read in the same batch the adapter reads them in. The class statements list is read whole,
-- as today. An unknown kind answers as `all`; a page below 1 is 1 and above 10000 is 10000 (Record.tsx's MAX_PAGE).
--
-- Only public projections and the caller's own rows are read, as the caller: `security invoker`, `stable`, SQL-standard
-- bodies whose dependencies Postgres records, held to tools/check-web-reads.mjs's lists by
-- supabase/tests/e2e/0016-screen-reads.ts. Neither writes anything: no view counted, nothing marked read.

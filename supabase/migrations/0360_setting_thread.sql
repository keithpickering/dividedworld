-- A thread named by a setting is found by its key (docs/plans/2026-11-13-setting-thread-plan.md; issue #648).
--
-- `systemAnnouncements` and `updatesThread` name a thread by its id, written as a JSON string, and five statements in four functions found that thread with
-- `settings s join threads t on t.id::text = s.value #>> '{}'`. A comparison on the id written as text cannot use threads_pkey, so each read a whole index of `threads`: the count of
-- entries it read moved with every dead entry (which made 0135's equal-reads assertion flaky) and grew with every thread an instance holds.
--
-- setting_thread(key) is the lookup, written once: the thread the setting names, or null. The value is read as a uuid only where it is a uuid's canonical text (lowercase, hyphenated: what
-- `id::text` writes), so it finds exactly what the text comparison found, and a stray value finds no thread and never raises inside a quote. A regular expression and not pg_input_is_valid,
-- which needs Postgres 16 and nothing else here does. The thread is then found with `t.id = <that uuid>`: one probe of threads_pkey whatever the instance holds. It is security definer with
-- execute revoked from every API role, as spring_facts and lay_sprung are: its callers are security definer.
--
-- The four callers are written whole, each with only its lookup changed: spring_facts as 0340 wrote it (its read stays unconditional, the same for every back, and now reads the same single
-- entry; nothing it reads is an owner, a class or a reactor), place_cast and lay_sprung as 0317 wrote them, seed_instance as 0355 wrote it (the last migration to define it). `create or replace` keeps each one's owner and grants.

-- The Boss's AWARD_TROPHY move (the cosmetics design, docs/plans/2026-11-04-cosmetics-design.md, section 4; the plan, Task 5).
--
-- The Boss gives a character one of the trophies on the instance's Boss list (trophy_kinds.boss_gives), or a belt. A favor: it carries no demand and no punishment, and the
-- award is its whole effect, so the move ends the moment it lands (`spent`) and the trophy stays. An admin takes the award back with reverse_award (0206), as any other.
--
-- The limits, held here as the engine holds them in moveParamsProblems (engine/system/moves.ts): the trophy is on the Boss's list; the character is not staff, not retired and has
-- debuted; a trophy that is not a belt is not given to a character that already has it standing this season; a belt is not given to its holder. The queue's guard (0140) checks a kind
-- and its office and nothing more here, so the limits are read when the move lands: a move that cannot land is refused for good, with the reason on its queue row (`failure`), as a
-- machine move is, and no Act and no award is written. The meeting drops such a move before it is ever queued (engine/system/meeting.ts, repairAnswer).
--
-- The masks. A trophy and who holds it are public in play (a postbit shows it; a belt's holder is on its page), so boss_trophies and trophy_award_facts read trophy rows and
-- characters' staff and retired state and nothing about an account, a wardrobe or an owner. They are the service role's, the meeting's.

-- What is wrong with giving this trophy to this character now, or null. The words are plain and the same for every caller.

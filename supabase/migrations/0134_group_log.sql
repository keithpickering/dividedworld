-- The log's lines for a staff member moving one of the player's characters into a group (docs/plans/2026-11-06-member-groups-plan.md, Task 11).
--
--   my_group_moves   A row for each landed `conferGroup` move on one of the caller's own characters: the move's Act and its place in the announcements thread (what the line
--                    links to), the character, the group's key and the board it bars (with the board's name), when it ends now (move_expires_at, so an appeal's ruling is read in
--                    place of the move's own end) and when it was set to end as it landed (`landed_until`, the Act's own), a favor's check, the office the move landed under (the stamp 0137 writes on the Act, else the Boss's; the line's role word, and the hearer's, who is the move's own staff member), how the move ended (`ended_why`: met, expired, reversed, unmet,
--                    overturned, superseded or spent; `ended_by`), and the latest appeal ruling on it (verdict, when, the end it set): a refunded appeal can be made again, so a move may have several appeals and still has one row. The group's name is not here: it
--                    is the instance's own content, which the screen holds.
--
--   log_page         (0125) also answers `groupMoves`, my_group_moves' rows as log() reads them, and its `people` carry their `group`, so the one-read Log shows the
--                    group lines the views show. alerts_page (0125)'s `people` carry their `group` too.
--
-- Masks. A group move, its end and a ruling are public Acts, so every column is a public fact about the character. The view keeps only the caller's own characters
-- (characters' own-rows policy and `owner = auth.uid()`), as my_bans does, so a third player sees nothing and no row says who else is in a group. No alert: the log is where it shows.
-- Ways out. The view is a read; each row says how the move ends (its end, its demand, an appeal or an admin) in the words the screen puts beside it.

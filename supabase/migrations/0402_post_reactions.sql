-- A post-local reaction (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-part-3-plan.md, Task 5; supabase/tests/0169-post-reactions.sql; engine/rules/emoji.ts). A cast card that adds a reaction (card_kinds.adds_reaction, 0400) puts one emoji
-- and the quadrant it scores in on the one post it is cast on, for every player to give. The sections:
--     1. post_reaction_kinds   a row per play: the post, the key, the emoji, the quadrant and the play. Insert-only (its own append-only pair), readable by signed-in players (it is the play's public configuration again).
--     2. the keys              reaction_kinds.key may not start with `x-`; reactions.kind and reaction_tallies.kind lose their foreign keys to reaction_kinds, and a trigger on each holds what the key held: the kind is one of
--                              reaction_kinds, or one of post_reaction_kinds for that Act (every writer of either table passes it: react is the only one).
--     3. reaction_quadrant     the instance kind's quadrant, else the post-local kind's on that Act.
--     4. the landing           land_refusal and land_rows (0400) extended for a reaction card, and place_cast raising what land_refusal says under the SQLSTATE land_refusal_code gives it (23505 for a key the post already holds).
--     5. react                 takes a post-local kind whose play is not ended; an ended one is refused in words that say so.
--     6. by quadrant           settlement_input and estimate_input send `quadrant` on a reaction whose kind starts with `x-`; act_window_counts, demand_progress, demand_contributors and system_digest read reaction_quadrant
--                              where they joined reaction_kinds.
--
-- Masks ("A response never proves a private fact"): nothing here reads who reacted or who owns a character. A post-local kind is public as its play is (the post, the emoji and the quadrant are on the card's own Act),
-- every refusal is read from public facts (the instance's emoji, the post's kinds) and is the same for every caster, and a tally of a post-local kind obeys the policy of every other tally (a blind post's is withheld,
-- 0401). The key is built in SQL as engine/rules/emoji.ts's localKey builds it, and the base compared is emojiBase's. SQL cannot tell an emoji from other text: that is the Edge Function's validateConfig (localReaction),
-- and the table's checks hold what a key and a row may be.
-- An emoji once added to a post cannot be added to it again, even after an admin's end, so reactions already given never change quadrant: the key is the post's primary key whether or not its play is over.

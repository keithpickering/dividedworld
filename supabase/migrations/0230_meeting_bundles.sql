-- The meeting queues beats and bundles (docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-plan.md, Task 6; docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-design.md, sections 2, 3, 5 and 9).
--
--   meeting_context     (0220) also hands the meeting the Boss's arc: `arc` is arc_for_meeting (0229), the beats unlocked and not yet played, each with whether it is due, and the kinds still held back. Never a
--                       locked beat, a brief or a template: briefs and templates are the instance's, read in code, so what the database cannot name cannot leak.
--   apply_meeting       (0220) also queues the answer's `bundles`: each is all or nothing (a savepoint a part's refusal rolls back), its parts under one bundle id and one name in the order sent, so a
--                       role names an earlier part. A bundle that names a beat of this Boss's that is unlocked and unplayed is authored and costs the bank nothing, and writes `played` to arc_beat_events,
--                       with the bundle, in the same transaction; a bundle with no beat is the Boss's own, one move a part, at most bundleMostParts parts, of no kind that is held back, and it needs the bank.
--                       A beat with no bundle has no parts, and is played by being named. What is refused is skipped and recorded on the meeting's record as `bundlesSkipped` ({index, name, why}), and a
--                       move of a kind held back as `heldBackSkipped` ({index, kind}); neither costs a move and neither fails the answer.
--   queued_moves_guard  (0225) also admits `{role, beat}` where a board goes: the board the earlier beat's bundle made (beat_role_board, 0228), which must have landed. The part depends on the move that
--                       made it, as a later move into a made board does, so an admin's hold or reversal of the creation follows it.
--   system_tick         (0228) lands a `{role, beat}` on the real board, resolved from the landed Acts at landing as a role of the part's own bundle is.
--   system_tick         (0235) takes the global place key (lock_thread_places) ONCE, before its landing loop, whenever a lasting move is due or one is in force (so a lasting end it makes later, by expiry
--                       or a demand, is covered), and a merge's board key (lock_board_closing) when a merge lands, both held to the end of the tick: the writers of a place wait for each other, and the
--                       one lock order is the global key first, then an Act written into the announcements thread (final review of PR #450, F7; delta review F13: the tick used to take the key at its
--                       first lasting landing, after earlier landings had written into the thread an admin's reversal writes its end into, and the two waited for each other).
--   meeting_season      the season a meeting was held in: where `{role, beat}` is read from at landing, whenever that is.
--
-- A beat's way out is Task 5's: a due beat is played at the next meeting with its defaults, an optional one lapses at the season's end. A bundle an admin holds or reverses is the admin queue's.
-- Cost: each read is one persona's beats (at most 24) and one season's events of that persona; a bundle's parts are at most bundleAuthoredMostParts (16 at the most), and nothing here grows with the
-- Acts, boards or players an instance holds.
--
-- Merged with main's 0154 (#469): system_tick ends a visit that cannot be filed as 'dropped' (end_visit(..., 'dropped', ...)), no longer 'reversed'; carried into this definition, which is built on 0140's body.
-- Port from main (#486, supabase/migrations/0193_meeting_parts.sql, which now runs before this one): apply_meeting writes the Boss's staff_memory row only when the payload's `memory` is an object, and its
-- staff_profiles row only when `profile` is, so a part of the meeting that failed leaves the Boss's memory or profile as it was (both tables are append-only, so "as it was" is the last row). Everything else in
-- apply_meeting is as this file writes it.
--
-- Ported onto main (merge of #449 Cosmetics, migrations 0205-0213): system_tick: rebuilt on 0208's body, as in 0216.

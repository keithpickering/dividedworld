-- Card payouts: skim, ride and scored-as (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-part-6-plan.md, Tasks 4 and 5; design docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-design.md, section 2).
--
-- This file is written in sections, one per task part, each a whole change of its own, as 0148 is:
--
--   Task 4, the schema and the plays:
--     1. the catalog         a card's key may begin with a digit (4d-chess); card_kinds gains `skim jsonb` and `scores_as boolean`; card_kinds_gimmick_kind takes 'ride'; check constraints hold the pairings (a ride on a post-alone card, a skim on a cast card
--                            that reaches a post alone with a `lasts` and no writes, scores_as on a cast card that reaches a character alone, an outcome only on a set card that springs on a cast, of kind ride).
--                            card_kinds_problem holds engine/rules/instance.ts's rules for all four again in the engine's words (card_share_problem is the share's) and lets a skim card have a `lasts`.
--     1b. meet_card          a card's key may open with a digit, as the catalog's check now allows.
--     2. scored_as_window    the window an Off Day names: the one after the next settlement, or the words of why none can be named. Public: settlements, seasons and settings only.
--     3. card_target         carries `quadrant` for a live play of a skim card.
--     4. place_cast          a skim card on a post (a quadrant, one live play per quadrant, `ends`), a cast that meets a ride back (`rode`), a scored-as card on a character (a class, a window, one per window, `starts`/`ends`).
--     5. place_set           a ride back is set with a quadrant.
--     6. spring_facts, spring_traps, lay_sprung, acts_spring_payload, acts_spring_by
--                            a ride back springs `did: rode` with its `quadrant` and writes no caught row; a face-down skim or scored-as card lands only when the same rules would let it be cast; the spring's payload
--                            takes ('cast', 'rode') and `quadrant`; an index by `by` for the settlement's reads.
--     7. seed_instance       writes `skim` and `scores_as`.
--   Task 5, what the settlement reads and records:
--     1. scored_as_plays     the one place that says which plays name a class for a window (the last settled window's scored-as plays, the earliest per character, not admin-ended); no API role's.
--     2. settlement_input    sends `quadrant`, `ends` of a skim play, the skim plays still up from earlier windows, a reacted cast's ride springs, ride gimmick plays and post, and `scoredAs`.
--     3. estimate_input      the same for the caller alone (their own plays; no other player's, so a bystander's input holds none), with `scoredAs` beside `windowStart`.
--     4. scored_as           what a settlement scored a character as (append-only, row security on and no policy); apply_settlement writes it from scored_as_plays; my_scored_as is the caller's own
--                            characters' rows; log_page sends them as `scoredAs`.
--
-- A skim play's `payload ->> 'ends'`. A Use card's play on a post is the only play there that has had an end of its own; a skim play (Mooch) now has one, `lasts` out from the cast, written as a Use's is. Every
-- reader of a post play's `ends` meets one now, and treats it as a Use's: it is up while `ends` is null or after now(), and over after, never reversed or shown as anything else.
--   place_cast          the skim stack counts the live plays naming the same quadrant on the post (a play whose `ends` has passed, or that an admin ended, holds no place); the generic stack stays for every other card.
--   spring_facts        the same count, over the quoting post's plays, in the query that already counted them (no extra card_ended call, so every back costs the same reads).
--   ward_refusal        its post branch reads `ends is null or ends > now()` of every play, a skim's included; a Mooch is no ward, so nothing about it changes.
--   card_target         sends `ends` with every live play on the post, now a skim's too, and its quadrant.
--   live_writing_plays  reads `ends` as a Use's; a skim card never writes, so it is never found there.
--   thread_page         sends the post's plays as they were written, `ends` among them; it reads the end of a play beyond a post (play_reach), never a post play's.
--   log_page            reads the end of a settlement and of a face-down card, never of a play.
--   admin_queue, reverse_card   read `ends` of a play as of a Use's: a play over by its time is no live play and is not ended again.
--   settlement_input, estimate_input   (Task 5) carry it for the settlement's skim reads.
--
-- Ways out: a skim play ends at its time (`lasts`), or by an admin (card_end); a ride back springs, is taken back or returns to the hand at setLasts, and what it paid is no state anyone is in; an Off Day
-- ends at its window's close, by itself, or by an admin before then; a refused play writes nothing.
-- Privacy ("A response never proves a private fact"): none of the refusals reads who owns the target. The skim's refusals read the post's public plays; the Off Day's read the character's public plays, and
-- scored_as_window reads settlements, seasons and settings, which are the same for every caster; a ride back springs for any caster of the named card, the setter's own other mask included, with the same Acts
-- and the same work. No money moves here: nothing in this part pays; the settlement does.
-- Each function below is copied from its latest definition (0142, 0144, 0148, 0149), changing only what is named at it; lock order and `set search_path` are as written there.

-- how many of the back's card are still up and name the back's own `config.quadrant` (a skim card's stack, which is one per quadrant), and whether that is a quadrant at all; (b) whether the back's
-- `config.class` is a class and whether the window a scored-as play would name can be named (scored_as_window, public) and the quoting character already has a class named for it (the plays on it, which the
-- query that counted them for the stack already reads, asked also of when they were made and whether their card scores as a class). A Move lands only when its own rule says so (spring_traps): a skim
-- card only when its quadrant is free, a scored-as card only when its window can be named and has no other. lay_sprung writes the same `ends` and `starts` place_cast does.
-- spring_traps (0148), for a cast trigger: `did` is `rode` where the back's trap has an outcome of kind ride, else `caught`. A `rode` spring's payload carries `quadrant` (the back's `config.quadrant`) and
-- no `caught`, and no `caught` row is written to the setter's card_ledger: the setter takes no card, the cast lands as any cast does (place_cast), and the setter is paid by the settlement for its votes.
-- acts_spring_payload takes the pair ('cast', 'rode') and an optional `quadrant` that is one of the four.

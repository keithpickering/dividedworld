-- Review fixes for the meeting's beats and bundles (supabase/migrations/0187_meeting_bundles.sql; docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-plan.md, Task 6).
--
--   The record says what was played. The engine writes `beatsDefaulted` and a `playedWithDefaults` trim for a due beat the answer left out, before apply_meeting runs; if the database then skips the
--   bundle (its guard refuses a part, or a beat was played in a race) the record would still say it was played. apply_meeting now writes `beatsPlayed` (what this transaction played) and keeps
--   `beatsDefaulted` and the `playedWithDefaults` trims only for those, and returns `beats_played` for the caller's outcome.
--   The meeting's season, everywhere. A meeting held in one season and applied or landed after the next opened must read one season: queued_moves_guard resolves {role, beat} in
--   meeting_season(new.meeting), and apply_meeting reads the beat's state, held-back kinds and writes `played` in it, as the tick already lands in it.
--   queued_moves_guard (0187) and apply_meeting (0187) are otherwise as 0187 wrote them.

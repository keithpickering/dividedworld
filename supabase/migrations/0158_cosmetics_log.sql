-- The log and the alerts of the cosmetics (the cosmetics plan, Task 12; docs/plans/2026-11-04-cosmetics-design.md).
--
-- What happened to a player's characters beside the game's Aura is the player's own log, in plain words and true ("The fiction may lie; the log never does"): a Random Event's find, gear
-- an admin gave, a trophy given or taken back, and a belt that passed to another character. `my_cosmetic_log` is the one read of all five, as `my_ledger` is of the Aura; each row is
-- the caller's own: an Event and a gear grant by the account, an award, a taking back and a belt lost by the owner of the character it happened to. A belt lost names the character that
-- took it (a public fact) and never its player; no row says who reacted or anyone's class. An event that found a card has a random_events row and a card_ledger row of kind `found`: the log
-- shows the Event's line alone (the card line reads the ledger and passes `found` over), so one event is one line. A gear copy found by an Event is likewise the Event's line, not the
-- ledger's.
--
-- Gear an admin gave names the mask it was given through (`gear_ledger.through`, written by grant_gear), so the line can say "through Dr. Bones" to the player whose mask it is; a grant made
-- before the column, or one of no mask, says nothing of one. The column is added, never updated: the ledger stays append-only. A grant is one statement and one instant, so its copies are one line.
--
-- Alerts: `trophy` and `beltLost` are written kinds (engine/rules/alerts.ts). A trigger on trophy_awards writes a `trophy` alert to the owner of the character an award is for, whoever gave it, and a
-- `beltLost` alert to the owner of the character that held the belt just before, when the belt passes to another character. An award by an admin or the season has no Act, so alerts.act may be
-- null (the Alerts read already left-joins it). Neither alert names who gave or took: the log says. A staff character has no owner and is never given a trophy. The cost is one indexed read
-- and one alert per award, and one more per belt passed, so a season's three places cost three. alerts_kind_check and account_preferences_toasts_check, set_preferences and settings_held list the kinds as
-- one list (engine/rules/alerts.test.ts holds them to it), each redefined whole from its latest definition: set_preferences from 0145, settings_held from 0150, log_page from 0155.
--
-- Ways out: nothing here adds a state a player can be put in; an alert is read and cleared as every alert is.

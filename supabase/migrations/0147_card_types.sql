-- Card types: Moves, Reversals and Gimmicks (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-types-design.md; plan docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-types-plan.md, Tasks 3 and 4).
--
-- This file is written in sections, one per task, each a whole change of its own:
--
--   Task 3, the schema:
--     1. the catalog        card_kinds drops `ward boolean` and gains `gimmick jsonb` (a use card's effect: ward, earn or price); `trap` holds `match` when a Reversal has one.
--                           A ward row already held becomes the ward Gimmick it was: `{"kind": "ward", "upTo": <its rarity>}`, turning away casts at or below its own rarity as it did.
--                           A use card held with no ward (so no gimmick) is left as it is too, and is refused at the next seed_instance by name, as is a set card with no trap.
--                           A set card held with no trap (a Bluff) is left as it is; the next seed_instance refuses it by name and the instance's own cards no longer hold one.
--     2. card_kinds_problem the checks of the engine's instanceProblems that SQL can make, in the engine's words (use card: gimmick, time up, reaches; set card: trap).
--     3. the readers        card_target and reach_effects carry `gimmick` where they carried `ward`. effects_above carries no card kind (its 0092 definition names none), so it is not replaced.
--     4. ward_refusal       the one test of a ward, read by place_cast (every reach) and spring_facts (a post): rarity at or below `upTo`, printed flavor in `flavors`, key in `cards`.
--     5. place_cast         a ward at every reach on the cast's own target; a use card at thread reach only on a thread one's own character started; a use card on a board refused.
--     6. spring_facts       step 4b is the same ward test.
--     7. seed_instance      sends `gimmick` in place of `ward`, and `trap` with its match.
--
-- Ways out: a Gimmick ends at its time (`lasts`, required of every use card by card_kinds_gimmick_lasts and card_kinds_problem), or by an admin (card_end); a refusal writes nothing.
-- Privacy: a ward's refusal reads only the target's public plays and the incoming card's printed name, flavor and rarity, the same for every caster; the own-thread check reads
-- who started the thread, which is public, against the caster's own character, and tells the caller only about their own.
-- Each function below is copied from its latest definition (0092, 0139, 0142, 0144), changing only what is named at it; lock order is as written there.

update card_kinds set gimmick = jsonb_build_object('kind', 'ward', 'upTo', rarity) where ward;

  -- A Gimmick ends at its time: its way out.
  add constraint card_kinds_gimmick_lasts check (gimmick is null or lasts is not null);

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. card_kinds_problem ----

-- card_kinds_problem (0142), holding instanceProblems's rules for a card's play, trap and gimmick again, in the engine's words: only a set card has a trap and every set card has one,
-- only a use card has a gimmick and every use card has one, of a kind the engine knows, a time up and reaches of a post, a character or a thread. A JSON null trap is as absent as no key; a JSON null gimmick is read as the engine reads it, a gimmick that is not an object.
-- The match of a trap and the numbers of a gimmick are checked by instanceProblems alone (the seed is built from an instance that passed it). Everything else as 0142 wrote it.

-- ============================================================================ Task 4: Reversals, take-back and the hand ====
-- A Reversal springs on a cast it names or matches, a face-down card goes back to its setter's hand at any time before it springs and when its time ends unsprung, and the settlement is given
-- what the card types need (design sections 3, 4 and 6; plan Task 4). Each function below is copied from its latest definition and changed only where it is said.
--
--   1. the Acts, the ledger   acts_kind_check and acts_seq_check gain `take_back` (an Act of the back's post's author, on that post, payload {set}, no card, no seq); acts_take_back_payload holds its
--                             shape; acts_one_take_back is one take-back per back, found by index; acts_well_formed (0114) refuses one that is not of a live back on its own post by its own author;
--                             card_ledger gains `returned` (a take-back's row, carrying the Act), the hand's one new row kind; face_down_account_card is the index card_held's time term reads by.
--   2. place_set              (0144) refuses a set card with no trap ("<name> has no trap to spring"), a named catch or a match rarer than the set card ("<name> names cards up to <rarity>"), and a match beside a named
--                             catch; a cast Reversal waits for a name or a match; a post's live check counts a take-back as an end.
--   3. take_back              the door: take_back(who, through, set_act), the service role's (granted as set_card is; no Edge Function calls either yet), under set_card's locks in its order.
--   4. spring_facts, spring_traps  a cast back springs on the card it names or the card its match holds (flavor in `flavors`, rarity at or below `upTo` and at or below the back's own); every back reads the incoming
--                             card's printed row and the match whatever it holds. A taken-back back springs nothing.
--   5. the back's end         card_target, my_face_down (with ended_by: sprung, taken back or time), and place_set above read a back as ended by its spring, a take-back naming it, or ends_at.
--   6. the hand               card_held = bought + pulled + caught + returned - played + the account's backs whose time passed unsprung and not taken back (read from face_down, never written, as an ended back
--                             writes nothing today); my_card_ledger shows a time-ended back as a `returned` line at its ends_at.
--   7. settlement_input, estimate_input   send `by` (a spring's), `ends` (a use card's play's) and `on` (a character-reach play's); and every live Earn play whose end is after the window's start, even one
--                             played before it (settle.ts boosts only with the play in the input), each with the post it is on.
--
-- Locks. take_back takes set_card's, in its order: the setter's `accounts` row (1), the post's `acts` row (2), the back's `face_down` row (3), then writes its Act and its ledger row. It takes no wallet (a take-back is free)
-- and no thread or count row (a take-back is neither counted nor numbered). place_set, spring_facts and spring_traps take what they took. A spring and a take-back of one back meet at (3): the one that locks
-- the row second re-reads, finds the other's Act, and does nothing (spring_traps) or refuses (take_back).
-- Masks. take_back refuses another account's back, another of the setter's masks, a post that is no back, a back that does not exist and a back already sprung, taken back or past its time in the same words,
-- and reads nothing about the card; every take-back writes the same Act and a ledger row of the same shape. A time-ended back writes nothing: its return is read only by the setter's own card_held and
-- my_card_ledger (row security on face_down and card_ledger). spring_facts reads the incoming card's printed name, flavor and rarity, public to every caster. Carried Earn plays are public Acts.
-- Ways out. A back ends by a spring, a take-back, or its time, and each of those returns the card or spends it by what happened (a spring spends it, the other two return it); nothing here adds a state a player can be put
-- in. A take-back past a back's time is refused because the back is already over and the card already in the hand.
-- Cost at a busy instance's scale. card_held reads the account's own rows of the card in card_ledger (card_ledger_account) and in face_down (face_down_account_card), one probe each of acts_one_spring and acts_one_take_back
-- per ended back of that card: linear in that account's backs of that card, never the instance's. The carried Earn plays are found by the card Acts' creation time (a window of the longest Earn `lasts` before the window) through acts_card_created, a partial index over card plays alone: without it the range
-- scan of acts_created read every Act of every kind in the span (explain on 300,000 Acts, 20,000 of them card plays: 95,045 index rows read for 8,640 plays; 8,640 with it).

-- The staff rung replaces the staffGroup setting (docs/plans/2026-11-06-member-groups-plan.md, Task 9).
--
-- The staff group's name was a setting, `staffGroup`, that the seed wrote and screen_settings carried to the screens. The ladder's staff rung (group_kinds, 0116) now
-- is that group: a staff character's `group` names it (group_now), and the screens read its name, color and stripe from screen_settings' `groups`. So:
--   seed_instance      as 0117 wrote it, without the insert of the `staffGroup` setting. A payload that still carries `system.staffGroup` is not read; a settings row an earlier
--                      seed wrote stays where it is, read by no one (the view below no longer lists it), so an instance seeded before this change still boots.
--   screen_settings    as 0116 wrote it, without `staffGroup` in its list of settings, and each group also saying whether it is the staff rung (`staff`, the ladder's rung whose
--                      condition is 'staff'), so a screen names the staff group without reading any character.
-- Masks. Public data only, as before: the staff rung's look is a group's look. Ways out. Adds no state.

-- seed_instance (0117), no longer writing the `staffGroup` setting. Everything else as 0117 wrote it.

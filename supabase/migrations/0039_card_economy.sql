-- The screens price cards as the server does (#86; the glass cleanup's design, section 4,
-- docs/plans/2026-10-31-glass-cleanup-design.md). The Vending Machine and the play form priced with the
-- compiled settings, while the act function prices with the economy row an admin tunes
-- (withDatabaseSettings), so a tuned price showed the code's number until the server's refusal or
-- charge said otherwise: an out-of-character number that was not true.
--
-- screen_settings kept the whole economy out (0030, 0036) because the economy also holds the classes'
-- numbers, which no screen needs. Only what a card's price reads joins it now, under one key,
-- `cardEconomy`: each card's price_setting and the keys its rules list in `reads`, which seed_instance
-- records on card_kinds from the instance's cards. The view reads them from the live economy row, so an
-- admin's tuning shows at once. An instance seeded before this holds no `reads` until it is seeded
-- again; `cardEconomy` then holds each price alone, and a screen takes any key it lacks from the
-- compiled economy, as it does every setting screen_settings lacks.
--
-- A card's price is not a private fact: the machine shows it to everyone, and every reader, signed in
-- or not, gets the same numbers. The classes' numbers stay out.

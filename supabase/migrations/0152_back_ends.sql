-- A face-down card's end is the server's (docs/plans/2026-11-11-plain-words-plan.md, Task 8). place_set stores it when the card is set (face_down.ends_at, 0148), and
-- card_target and my_face_down answer it, but the screens read a set as an Act and worked its end out again from the setting. acts_public now says it of a set, last, so every
-- column before it is as it was: the set's `ends_at`, the face_down row's, null for any other Act. It is public and the same for every reader: every back lasts the same
-- span from when it was set, so it says nothing of the card, who set it, or whether it is any player's. The view reads face_down as its owner, as it reads the refunds.

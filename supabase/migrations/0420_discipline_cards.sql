-- The discipline cards: the catalog, a play that is over at once, relief and the lift (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-part-5-plan.md, Tasks 2, 3 and 4; the design docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-design.md,
-- "Happy Heart, Super Happy Heart, Ultra Happy Heart", "Take the Fall" and "Tattle-Tale"). Written in sections, one for each task, as 0148_card_types.sql is.

-- A card with a `discipline` does something to the staff's discipline of its target, one of a fixed list of four kinds the code maps to an effect with limits (The System acts; it never destroys what a player wrote):
--   relief  on a character: takes its oldest live points off its warn bar, the least band or all of them        unban  on a character: ends every ban running on it
--   fall    on another character's post: the next filing lands on the caster (section 3)                       watch  on a character: weights it up in a patrol's draw while it lasts (migration B)
-- A relief and an unban are over when they land: no time up, no stack, no play_reach row; they leave rows beside their play (warn_reliefs, ban_lifts) and the reads below subtract them. The Act is never changed.
--
-- ===================================================================================================== Section 1 (Task 2) ====
-- The catalog, a play that is over at once, relief and the lift.
--   1. card_kinds                  gains `discipline`; checks: null or an object of one of the four kinds, only where play = 'cast', a time up for a watch alone. card_kinds_beyond_lasts (0055) lets a relief and an
--                                  unban reach a character with no time up. card_kinds_problem and card_reach_problem say the same in the engine's words (instance.ts, disciplineProblems and reachProblems);
--                                  seed_instance writes the column.
--   2. face_down_never_writes      widened (as 0153 and 0343 widened it): a card with a discipline is cast face up and never set face down, in the words the engine's decideSet gives. place_cast refuses a staff caster.
--   3. warn_reliefs, ban_lifts     the rows, append-only, nobody's to read or write (row-level security on, no grant), written only by place_cast.
--   4. card_relief, warn_points, ban_ends, banned_until, my_bans, punishment_running   the reads: a bar counts each infraction less its relief and its cards' relief; a ban ends at the least of its own end (an appeal's
--                                  ruling read in place of it) and the time of the first live lift. An admin's end of the play (card_ended) takes it out of both, computed. infract's ladder count is not changed:
--                                  a lifted ban still counts toward the next.
--   5. card_target_reach           the character branch also carries the character's bar and ban, public facts the engine's disciplineRefusal reads (warnPoints, bannedUntil).
--   6. place_cast                  a staff target is refused; a relief on an empty bar and an unban on a character not banned are refused before anything is written (play_card spends after, in the same transaction, so a
--                                  refused card is not spent); a relief or an unban writes no `ends`, no play_reach row and takes no stack place; its payload says `instant` and what it took or lifted; the rows follow the Act.
--                                  The ward test still runs.
-- reverse_card is unchanged: an instant play has no `ends` and no play_reach row, so an admin may end it at any time.
--
-- Ways out: a refused heart writes and spends nothing. Points a heart took off and a ban an Unban ended need none to leave: an admin's end of the play (reverse_card) puts them back, computed. A card with a discipline
-- is never set face down (nothing to take back).
-- Privacy: a refusal reads the target's public bar and bans (both are on every postbit) and its public staff flag, so it is the same words, price and timing whoever owns the caster or the target; the relief rows name
-- public Acts and are read by nobody.
-- Cost at a busy instance's scale: warn_points gains one probe of warn_reliefs (by infraction) for each live infraction, and a character's bar holds a handful of them; banned_until gains one probe of ban_lifts for each ban
-- of the character. A heart reads the character's infractions through acts_infractions and writes at most as many rows as it has live infractions; an unban writes one row for each running ban.

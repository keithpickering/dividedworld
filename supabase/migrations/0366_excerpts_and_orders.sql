-- Cut excerpts say so, and an order ends with the office (docs/plans/2026-11-13-excerpts-and-orders-design.md, sections 1 and 2).
--
-- 1. pool_thread (0317) and system_digest (0359) return `cut` beside each post's words (the digest's beside each excerpt's `text`): whether the post was longer than `chars`, measured on the whole post
--    and not on the left()-cut words, which are read as today. A flag, not a character more, so a reader that does not know the setting still knows. Everything else in pool_thread as 0317 wrote it, and in
--    system_digest as 0359 wrote it.
-- 2. apply_meeting (0338) carries an order forward only for a persona on staff (staff_now). A persona off staff (a Boss, or a Mod moved off) is carried nothing: where its latest row still holds a line, a
--    beat or an allowance, the meeting writes it one blank row with an allowance of 0, which ends the order (and keeps the allowance from being returned to the bank a second time), and once the latest row is
--    blank it writes none. Everything else in apply_meeting as 0338 wrote it.
-- 3. mod_standing (0106) returns `order` only while the persona's office is 'mod' (a blank line reads null). Everything else in mod_standing as 0106 wrote it. The rows already written stay: they are
--    the record of what was given, and are no longer read for a persona out of the Mod office.
-- Each function keeps its owner, security definer, search_path and grants (create or replace).

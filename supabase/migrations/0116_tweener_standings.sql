-- Every reactor's paid vote on an Act the window touched is in settlement_input's `paid`
-- (docs/plans/2026-11-07-tweener-design.md, section 9).
--
-- Until now `paid` held a paid vote only for a player who reacted in this window, joined on
-- (act, reactor_account) from win_reactions. The Tweener's balance reads every player's reaction
-- on an Act whenever it is settled, so a player who voted in an earlier window and did not react
-- again must have their earlier paid vote in the input too, or settle.ts meets their earlier
-- reaction (earlier_reactions names it) with nothing paid for it and pays it again. So `paid`
-- reads paid_votes joined to `reacted` on the Act alone: every reactor's paid vote on each Act
-- with a reaction in the window. A window in which nobody reacted to an Act carries none of its
-- paid votes. apply_settlement (0073) is untouched: it refuses a changed weight, and the engine's
-- payVotes returns only the pairs a window touched, so untouched rows are never written back.
--
-- The index leads with the Act: the primary key (account, act) leads by account and cannot serve
-- this join.
--
-- Everything else in settlement_input is as 0092_card_end.sql wrote it. estimate_input is not
-- changed: the estimate does not read `paid`.

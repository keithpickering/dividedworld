-- Card types: Moves, Reversals and Gimmicks (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-types-design.md; plan docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-types-plan.md, Tasks 3 and 4).
--
-- This file is written in sections, one per task, each a whole change of its own:
--
--   Task 3, the schema:
--     1. the catalog        card_kinds drops `ward boolean` and gains `gimmick jsonb` (a use card's effect: ward, earn or price); `trap` holds `match` when a Reversal has one.
--                           A ward row already held becomes the ward Gimmick it was: `{"kind": "ward", "upTo": <its rarity>}`, turning away casts at or below its own rarity as it did.
--                           A use card held with no ward (so no gimmick) is left as it is too, and is refused at the next seed_instance by name, as is a set card with no trap.
--                           A set card held with no trap (a Bluff) is left as it is; the next seed_instance refuses it by name and the instance's own cards no longer hold one.
--     2. card_kinds_problem the checks of the engine's instanceProblems that SQL can make, in the engine's words (use card: gimmick, time up, reaches; set card: trap).
--     3. the readers        card_target and reach_effects carry `gimmick` where they carried `ward`. effects_above carries no card kind (its 0092 definition names none), so it is not replaced.
--     4. ward_refusal       the one test of a ward, read by place_cast (every reach) and spring_facts (a post): rarity at or below `upTo`, printed flavor in `flavors`, key in `cards`.
--     5. place_cast         a ward at every reach on the cast's own target; a use card at thread reach only on a thread one's own character started; a use card on a board refused.
--     6. spring_facts       step 4b is the same ward test.
--     7. seed_instance      sends `gimmick` in place of `ward`, and `trap` with its match.
--
-- Ways out: a Gimmick ends at its time (`lasts`, required of every use card by card_kinds_gimmick_lasts and card_kinds_problem), or by an admin (card_end); a refusal writes nothing.
-- Privacy: a ward's refusal reads only the target's public plays and the incoming card's printed name, flavor and rarity, the same for every caster; the own-thread check reads
-- who started the thread, which is public, against the caster's own character, and tells the caller only about their own.
-- Each function below is copied from its latest definition (0092, 0139, 0142, 0144), changing only what is named at it; lock order is as written there.

update card_kinds set gimmick = jsonb_build_object('kind', 'ward', 'upTo', rarity) where ward;

  -- A Gimmick ends at its time: its way out.
  add constraint card_kinds_gimmick_lasts check (gimmick is null or lasts is not null);

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. card_kinds_problem ----

-- card_kinds_problem (0142), holding instanceProblems's rules for a card's play, trap and gimmick again, in the engine's words: only a set card has a trap and every set card has one,
-- only a use card has a gimmick and every use card has one, of a kind the engine knows, a time up and reaches of a post, a character or a thread. A JSON null trap is as absent as no key; a JSON null gimmick is read as the engine reads it, a gimmick that is not an object.
-- The match of a trap and the numbers of a gimmick are checked by instanceProblems alone (the seed is built from an instance that passed it). Everything else as 0142 wrote it.

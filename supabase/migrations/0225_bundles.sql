-- Bundles: parts, roles and dependency (docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-design.md, section 5; docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-plan.md, Task 4).
--
-- A bundle is queued moves sharing one `bundle` id and one `bundle_name`; each part is an ordinary queued move with its own Act when it lands, so the log says exactly what each did. A part
-- names another part's result by its role: {"role": "minus"} where a board goes (a part's `board`, `into` or `fallback`; never a thread), and the role is the board the part of that role made,
-- put in the landed Act when the part lands. A part waits for the parts it names, is refused with one that was refused and is held with one that was held.
--
--   queued_moves    gains `bundle`, `bundle_name`, `role` and `depends_on` (the queued moves this one builds on). The bundle's name is a column of its parts, not a table of its own: a bundle has no
--                   other state of its own to keep, a table would add a row to make before the first part and a join on every read of the queue, and the guard holds every part of one bundle to one name.
--                   `depends_on` is set by the guard alone: the parts a part's roles name, and the move that made a board a later move names by its id (a move queued at a later meeting, outside any
--                   bundle, into a board a createBoard made). It is recorded when the move is queued, as the design says.
--   move_dependencies   (act, on_act): written when a dependent move lands, one row for each move it builds on. Insert-only, its guards fire always; reverse_move reads it to follow a reversal.
--   hold_move       holds the move and, in the same transaction and at the same instant, every move still waiting that builds on it, breadth first. Holding a part never holds what it builds on.
--   reverse_move    ends the move as reversed and, in the same transaction, every landed move that builds on it, breadth first, each as reversed by the admin with an end of its own, and holds every move
--                   still waiting that builds on one of them. An admin may hold or reverse any one part, and what builds on it follows.
--   admin_queue     says each part's `bundle`, `role` and `bundleName` in every group a part can be in.
--   moves_log       gains `bundle` and `role` at its end.
--   role_board      the board the part of a role in a bundle made: the one place a role is resolved, so that a role from an earlier beat (Task 9's {role, beat}) is one more argument here.
--
-- What is not a dependent. A later renameBoard, setRule or conferGroup that names a made board does not build on its creation: it changes only how a board is called, ruled or barred, and stands
-- or ends by its own expiry or an admin's word; reversing the creation closes the board, and none of those leaves a thread without a board or a player in a state with no way out.
-- Only the three moves that put threads and boards in places (createBoard, moveThread, mergeBoard) record a dependency.
--
-- Cost on a busy instance. Following a hold reads queued_moves by a partial GIN index on `depends_on` over the rows still waiting, and following a reversal reads move_dependencies by `on_act`:
-- each costs the dependents of the move, never the history of moves or of Acts.
-- Its way out: a held or reversed part is over, as any held or reversed move is, and the Boss chooses again at its next meeting. A part that waits for a part that is held or refused is held or
-- refused with it, so no part waits for good.
--
-- Merged with main's 0154 (#469): system_tick ends a visit that cannot be filed as 'dropped' (end_visit(..., 'dropped', ...)), no longer 'reversed'; carried into this definition, which is built on 0140's body.
-- Merged with main's 0154 (#469): moves_log reads a visit's own end ('reversed' with no by_act) as 'dropped'; carried into this definition, which is built on 0135's body.

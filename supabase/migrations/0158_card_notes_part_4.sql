-- Card notes, Part 4: Sugar Coat, Hype-Up and Last Word (docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-part-4-plan.md, Task 3; design docs/plans/2026-11-11-card-notes-design.md, section 2).
--
-- Sugar Coat is instance content only (a ward that names flavors is whole). Hype-Up needs an Earn a cast card carries on a character; Last Word needs a No quote the database holds at the write. This file is the schema for both, in
-- sections, each a whole change of its own:
--
--     1. the catalog       card_kinds_gimmick_use is dropped and added again: a cast card that reaches a character alone may carry an earn, which is the only gimmick a card that is not a use card has.
--                          card_kinds_gimmick_kind takes 'noQuote'; card_kinds_no_quote_post holds a no-quote card to a post alone. card_kinds_problem holds the three in the engine's words
--                          (engine/rules/instance.ts, playProblems and gimmickProblems; the kind list there is built from GIMMICK_KINDS). No row a database holds changes: no card on main is either.
--     2. bbcode_walk       returns a third column, `quotes`: the Act of every real quote the walk makes a frame for, lowercase, in the order they open, each once (a quote past max_depth is text and is not listed; a
--                          quote inside [code] or [noparse] is not a quote). Written by index as out[] is, so the walk stays linear. engine/bbcode/visible.ts's quotedActs is the same list, and the generated
--                          supabase/tests/0117-bbcode-plain.sql holds the two to each other for every fixture. bbcode_plain is stated again unchanged, with both functions' grants.
--     3. no_quote_on       the live No quote plays on a post, the latest-ending first. Stable, security definer, for no API role; it reads only the post's public plays.
--     4. acts_quote_guard  a before-insert trigger on acts for a post, a spin or an edit: what the new Act quotes (a post's `quoting` target, and every real quote in its body, at any depth) is refused, before it is written,
--                          when a live No quote is on the quoted post, in engine/rules/cards.ts's noQuoteWords. The same for every writer, the quoted post's author and a staff character included. An edit is refused
--                          only for a quote it adds. The import writes as a replica, where triggers do not fire.
--     5. write_staff_act   a pool post whose target holds a live No quote is written with no target, as a plain reply, so the paid answer is kept.
--     6. place_cast        a staff character casts no card that carries a gimmick (a cast earn); a card that stops quotes is refused on a post that holds a live back. A cast earn on a character passes the use-card check
--                          that is not its own (that check is for a use card) and lands on anyone's character, by the stack count that follows.
--     7. place_set         no card is set face down on a post that holds a live No quote. staff_set_card sets through it, so a persona's set is held too.
--     8. settlement_input, estimate_input
--                          send `ends` for a card whose kind holds a gimmick (in place of a use card alone), and find the Earn plays of earlier windows among every card that has an earn, not only use cards. estimate_input
--                          also finds, in the open window, an Earn another player cast on the caller's character: it is the target's own boost, from a public play.
--
-- Ways out: Last Word ends at its time (`lasts`, a week) or by an admin (reverse_card); a post under it takes no back until then, the refusal names the time, and a post that holds a back takes no Last Word until the back
-- springs, ends, or its setter takes it back; a quote it refuses is refused before it is written, so the draft is kept and the reply without the quote always goes through; a post that already quoted stays as written and can be
-- edited. Hype-Up ends at its time (36 hours) or by an admin; it only raises an earning, so the character it is on has nothing to get out of. A staff character's refused cast writes and spends nothing.
-- Masks ("A response never proves a private fact"): the stopped quote's refusal is computed from the new Act's own body and target and the quoted post's public plays, the same words for every writer, and it reads no owner; the walk
-- runs only for a body that holds `[quote=`, which is the writer's own text, so its timing says nothing of anyone else. place_cast and place_set refuse on public facts alone (a back and a face-up play are both drawn for everyone),
-- doing the same reads whatever card is face down. Hype-Up's boost is applied in the settlement, which shows only each settled window's sums, and in the target's own estimate, from a play that is a public Act on the target's character;
-- the caster is told nothing that depends on what the target earns, on its class or on who owns it, and a cast on one's own other mask is not refused. A pool reply to a stopped post is a plain reply for a public reason.
-- Each function below is copied from its latest definition (0142, 0144, 0151, and 0153_drives for card_kinds_problem, place_cast, settlement_input and estimate_input, which keep its drive and needs-message words), changing only what is named at it; lock order and `set search_path` are as written there. post(), edit_post, spin_written, start_thread, lock_for_quote,
-- spring_facts, spring_traps and lay_sprung are not replaced: the guard takes no lock, and a quote already past it when a Last Word commits lands (the race the plan accepts).

-- its post, and neither is a quote), and every real quote in its body, at any depth. The walk runs only for a body that holds `[quote=` (case-insensitive); with no target and no such text the function returns at once. For an edit,
-- the Acts the post's current body already quotes are taken out first, so an edit is refused only for a quote it adds; that second walk runs only when the first list is not empty. The first Act of the list, in order, that
-- holds a live No quote is the refusal, naming the post by its number where it is in the thread written to, else "a post in another thread" (never its author: a post's author may be hidden). It is the same for every writer, and reads
-- the new Act's body and target and the quoted posts' public plays, never who owns anything. A quote of a name that is not an Act id is the fiction's and is passed over.

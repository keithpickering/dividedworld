-- Arcs: beats, conditions, held-back kinds and beat state (docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-design.md, sections 2, 3 and 7; docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-plan.md, Task 5).
--
-- A persona's arc is a list of beats; each has an unlock (conditions the code checks, each read from public facts only), and the tick writes `unlocked` once every one holds, and `lapsed`
-- for an optional beat when the season ends. The meeting plays a beat and writes `played` (Task 6). Held-back kinds (a kind a persona does not use until a beat unlocks) are seeded here,
-- for the meeting to read.
--
-- NAMES. An arc's "beat" is a step of a persona's plan. A Mod Bot's patrol beat (the boards it watches: `staff_beats` 0103, `patrols` 0110, `Persona.beats`) is another thing, so the tables here
-- are `arc_beat_events` and `persona_arcs`, and nothing here touches the patrol ones. `beat_condition_holds` and `condition_kinds` keep the plan's names.
--
--   condition_kinds     the engine's catalog of conditions (engine/system/conditions.ts), written by seed_instance; `beat_condition_holds` has a branch for every key, which supabase/tests/0186-arcs.sql
--                       proves by walking this table. No client reads it.
--   persona_arcs        one row a persona, written by seed_instance: its beats (key, mini, repeatable, unlock, due; never a brief or a template, which the meeting reads in code from the instance), the
--                       kinds it holds back until a beat (`holds_back`), and the phase lengths it overrides (`phase_days`), so SQL can read a persona's plan. No client reads it.
--   arc_beat_events     (season, staff, beat, event, bundle, at), insert-only (its guards fire always). A beat moves `unlocked`, then `played` (with the bundle the meeting queued, if the beat has one) or
--                       `lapsed`, once. A repeatable mini-arc may be `unlocked` again after `played`. The guard holds that order, so no writer can break it.
--   arc_season_span     the season's start and end and where its phases begin, with a persona's own phase lengths (the same arithmetic as engine/system/phases.ts, phaseAt).
--   arc_board_posts     a board's posts over the last N days, on the board each thread is on now.
--   arc_board           a board named in a condition: a uuid that is a board, or {role, beat}, the board that beat's part of that role made.
--   beat_role_board     the board the part of a role in an earlier beat's bundle made, read from the landed Acts (role_board 0225 on the bundle the beat was played with). Task 6 queues a bundle that
--                       names a role from an earlier beat, {role, beat}, and resolves it here.
--   beat_condition_holds(staff, season, condition) the one place a condition is read.
--   arc_pass            the pass the tick makes: reads the season's Boss alone, one persona with at most 24 beats, and writes `unlocked` and `lapsed`.
--   system_tick         (0225) also makes that pass, after landing.
--   seed_instance       (0214) also writes condition_kinds and persona_arcs. settings_held (0222) also holds bundleMostParts and bundleAuthoredMostParts (a whole number from 1 to 16).
--
-- THE MASKS. A condition reads posts per board, moves, demands and beat events, and nothing else: no one's player, no class, no one who reacted. supabase/tests/0186-arcs.sql greps each of
-- these definitions for the words that would say otherwise, and drives the grep red on a function planted with one.
--
-- Cost on a busy instance. A pass reads one persona's beats (at most 24, a bound the instance check holds) and the latest event of each in one read of arc_beat_events by (season, staff, beat);
-- a beat past its end (played and not repeatable, or lapsed) is not evaluated. A board's post count is the board's threads active in the window (threads_board_last_at) and, for each, its posts in
-- the window (acts_patrol_posts), so it costs the activity of one board over at most 90 days and never the history of posts. A reversal or a demand is a range of move ends since the season began
-- (acts_move_ends), the season's few moves. None of it grows with the Acts an instance holds.
--
-- Its way out: a beat that never unlocks costs no one anything, an optional beat lapses at the season's end, a due beat is required by the meeting (Task 6), and a bundle an admin holds leaves
-- the beat unlanded until the season's end, when what waited on it is over with the season.
--
-- Merged with main's 0154 (#469): system_tick ends a visit that cannot be filed as 'dropped' (end_visit(..., 'dropped', ...)), no longer 'reversed'; carried into this definition, which is built on 0140's body.

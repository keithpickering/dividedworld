-- The farewell and the handoff (docs/plans/2026-11-06-fangame-split-plan.md, Task 8; design section 6).
--
-- The season's end and the handover are one transaction at the last settlement (reveal_season, 0099; hand_over, 0082), so the results reach the glass and the new Boss is seated in the same moment, and
-- no model runs inside it. The Boss's last words are therefore written at its last meeting before the season's end:
--
--   a farewell   in character, at most postMaxLength; hand_over posts it as the outgoing Boss's post in the announcements thread in place of the stock line (`bossFarewell`), and the stock line
--                stands where none was written (the last meeting failed, ran out of budget, or the answer left it out) or it could not be posted.
--   a handoff    out of character, at most 2000 characters: why the season went the way it did and what the Boss would tell whoever is next. Players never see it: it is out of character, and the glass
--                never speaks as a character. Admins read it in the handover's to-do (admin_queue); the new Boss reads it at its meetings for inheritanceGraceDays after the handover.
--
-- A meeting is told to write them, and keeps them, only within farewellWindowHours (36 by default; a whole number of hours from 1 to 720) of the season's end: meeting_context gives such a meeting the
-- facts the code knows (`handoffFacts`), and apply_meeting stores what the answer holds, trimmed, with the trims recorded. A meeting that gives neither writes no row, so silence never displaces the words
-- of an earlier meeting.
--
--   handoffs         insert-only: one row per meeting that wrote words (season, staff, meeting, farewell, note, written_at). The latest row of a season stands (`handoffs_latest`). No API role is granted
--                    the table or the view: it is out of character and no player's. Three guards (update, delete, truncate), each firing always, so a restore cannot change a row.
--   handoff_facts    a pure read of public play over a season: the boards made, merged and closed in it, the beats played, the moves in force, and the five busiest and five quietest open boards by posts.
--                    The facts are the code's and cannot be wrong; it reads no owner, account, class or reaction. Live, never stored: the new Boss reads the world as it is.
--   predecessor_handoff   what a new Boss is handed: the facts for the season that ended, and the outgoing Boss's note (null where the last meeting failed: the facts alone).
--
-- Ways out: nothing here holds a player. A farewell that cannot be posted falls back to the stock line, and a handover that cannot post either still lands (best effort, as the stock line always was).
-- Cost at a busy instance: the facts count a season's posts per board once (the range of acts_posts_by_time, 0157, one primary-key read per post for its thread) and the lists are cut to five; they are read
-- once for a meeting in the farewell window and once for the new Boss's meetings in its grace, and once for each handover to-do an admin has not cleared, never for each player or Act read.
